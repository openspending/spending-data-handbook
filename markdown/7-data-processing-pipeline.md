# The data processing pipeline

While there are many different types of data, almost all data processing involves the same set of incremental stages.

1. **Acquisition**. Data is gathered or new data is generated (e.g through a survey, observations, or experiments).
2. **Extraction**. Data is converted from whatever input format has been acquired (e.g. XLS files, PDFs, or even plain text documents) into a form that can be used for further processing and analysis. This often involves loading data into a database system like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
3. **Cleaning and transformation**. Errors, inconsistencies, and duplicates are removed from the data. You may also combine two different datasets into a single table at this stage.
4. **Analysis**. Data is analyzed to address the research question. We will not cover analysis in great detail in the Handbookâ€”we assume that you are already the experts in working with your data and using e.g. economic models to answer your questions.
5. **Presentation**. The analysis of the data is presented in a form which is understandable to a particular audience and designed to achieve a particular outcome.

In this section of the Handbook, we will cover stages 1 through 4. The next section, "Presentation and Engagement", will cover stage 5.
