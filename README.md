Spending Data Handbook
======================

This is the master manuscript of the [Spending Data Handbook](http://community.openspending.org/research/handbook), the [OpenSpending community](http://community.openspending.org)'s guidebook to data-driven research on government spending data for journalists and civil society advocates.

These Markdown source files were originally exported from a [Google document manuscript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EkKcm36ixOZof1xDKSBNJHlDZtfGXZBRSyZkIMOaQg0/edit?usp=sharing), which has now been replaced by this repo as the main branch of the Handbook.
