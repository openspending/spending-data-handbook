Spending Data Handbook
======================

This is the master manuscript of the [Spending Data Handbook](http://community.openspending.org/research/handbook), the [OpenSpending community](http://community.openspending.org)'s guidebook to data-driven research on government spending data for journalists and civil society advocates.

These Markdown source files were originally exported from a [Google document manuscript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EkKcm36ixOZof1xDKSBNJHlDZtfGXZBRSyZkIMOaQg0/edit?usp=sharing), which has now been replaced by this repo as the main branch of the Handbook.

To revise or expand the Handbook, create a fork of this repo and place a pull request with proposed changes.

Also included in this repo is a Python script to (re-)post the Handbook on the [OpenSpending Community Site](http://community.openspending.org). The script's usage is detailed in a separate README in the `/scripts` directory.
