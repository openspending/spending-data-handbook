# Spending Data Handbook

Book content and scripts for the Spending Data Handbook.

With the exception of `0-index.md`, all of the source files in the [book](./book) directory are generated from [the SHD Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/document/d/1EkKcm36ixOZof1xDKSBNJHlDZtfGXZBRSyZkIMOaQg0/edit?usp=sharing).

The scripts which publish the Handbook are copied from [osi-push](https://github.com/nmashton/osi-push) with small modifications.
